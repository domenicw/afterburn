# Project After Burn

Project After Burn was created during IBM Codathon at ETHZ in 2019. The goal is to detect if a fire resparkes after it has been put out. Since it uses an independant sensor network, fire fighters cna be used at other locations, which desire more manpower.

## How to use

To start a node network with fifteen different nodes, type the following into your terminal.

```bash
python afterburn-simulation.py
```

## Dashboard

The dashboard can be seen [here](https://afterburn-v1.eu-gb.cf.appdomain.cloud/ui/#!/0?socketid=yJvcui0rOX93KvTVAAAT).

The map with the node locations can be viewed under this [link](https://afterburn-v1.eu-gb.cf.appdomain.cloud/worldmap/)
